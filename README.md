üå§Ô∏è Realtime Weather Application (Realtime Weather App)
This project is a demonstration developed using modern Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, showcasing how to build a clean and scalable Android application. The app retrieves instant weather data for a user-input location from a public weather API using Retrofit and displays it beautifully.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Language: Kotlin
UI Toolkit: Jetpack Compose (Modern, Declarative UI)
Data Management: Jetpack ViewModel & LiveData / State
Networking: Retrofit2
Serialization: Gson Converter
Asynchronous Operations: Kotlin Coroutines

üéØ Core Topics and Learning Objectives

1. Clean Architecture and Data Management
Layered Structure: Separation of the project into API, UI, and ViewModel layers to ensure scalability and testability.
ViewModel Usage: Preparing and managing lifecycle-aware data independently of the UI.
Unidirectional Data Flow: Implementing the principle of encapsulation using LiveData and MutableLiveData to safely manage and expose data.

2. Secure API Integration
Retrofit Integration: Defining network communication via RetrofitInstance and the WeatherAPI interface.
Model Creation: Mapping the incoming JSON data to usable data structures using Kotlin's data class (Model).
Safe State Management: Utilizing the sealed class structure to handle the three possible states of network operations: Loading, Success, and Error.

3. Modern UI with Jetpack Compose
Declarative UI: Building a modern and flexible UI with Composable functions instead of traditional XML.
State-Driven UI: Observing the weatherResult and dynamically updating the screen based on the incoming NetworkResponse state (e.g., showing an error message, displaying a CircularProgressIndicator for loading).
User Interface Design: Implementing a clean design that presents data (Location, Temperature, Wind Speed, Humidity, etc.) in an organized and readable manner.
